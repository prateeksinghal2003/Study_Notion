//This code defines a Mongoose pre-save hook that performs specific actions before a document is saved to a MongoDB database.


//OTPSchema.pre("save", ...):
// This is a Mongoose middleware that is triggered before a document is saved to the database.
// It is attached to the OTPSchema, meaning it applies to any document created using this schema.
// The "save" indicates that this middleware runs during the save operation.
// async function (next) {:}

// This hook is defined as an async function, allowing asynchronous operations (e.g., sending an email) to occur.
// next is a callback function provided by Mongoose. It must be called to indicate that the middleware has finished its work.


    // Only send an email when a new document is created
    // if (this.isNew)     

// if (this.isNew) {:}
// this refers to the current document being saved.
// this.isNew is a Mongoose property that is true if the document is newly created (as opposed to being updated).
// This ensures that the email is sent only for new documents and not when an existing document is updated.
        
// await sendVerificationEmail(this.email, this.otp):
// Calls the sendVerificationEmail function to send an email.
// Passes this.email (the recipientâ€™s email address) and this.otp (the OTP for verification) as arguments.
// The use of await ensures the email is sent before proceeding to the next steps.


// next();
// This tells Mongoose to proceed with the save operation after the middleware has finished executing.
// Without calling next(), the save operation would remain stuck and not complete.
